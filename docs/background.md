# Background

It started with my [VicBlog](https://github.com/viccrubs/VicBlog-FrontEnd), a blog frontend project, and then was used for [Tagx00.Frontend](https://github.com/trapx00/Tagx00), a crowd-sourcing tagging system running on [http://tagx00.ml/](http://tagx00.ml/). The boilerplate is the core of these projects and never shows inapplicability.
